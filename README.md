Forge Capabilities that can be shared by multiple mods.
This mod is responsible for registering the capabilities from the [API](https://github.com/CyclopsMC/CommonCapabilitiesAPI),
it also provides default implementations of these capabilities for various mods.

All stable releases (including deobfuscated builds) can be found on [CurseForge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/247007/files).

### Contributing
* Before submitting a pull request containing a new feature, please discuss this first with one of the lead developers.
* When fixing an accepted bug, make sure to declare this in the issue so that no duplicate fixes exist.
* All code must comply to our coding conventions, be clean and must be well documented.
* All capabilities for mods must be tested in a separate test mod, in the `src/test/java/` directory. 

### Dependency

Instead of adding the [CommonCapabilities API as a git submodule](https://github.com/CyclopsMC/CommonCapabilitiesAPI#using-the-api), you can also add this mod as a dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
repositories {
  maven {
    name "Cyclops Repo"
    url "https://dl.bintray.com/cyclopsmc/dev/"
  }
}

dependencies {
  deobfCompile "org.cyclops.commoncapabilities:CommonCapabilities:${mc_version}-${mod_version}"
}
```

All available versions can be found at the [Maven repo](https://dl.bintray.com/cyclopsmc/dev/org/cyclops/commoncapabilities/CommonCapabilities/).

### Issues
* All bug reports and other issues are appreciated. If the issue is a crash, please include the FULL Forge log.
* Before submission, first check for duplicates, including already closed issues since those can then be re-opened.

### Branching Strategy

For every major Minecraft version, two branches exist:

* `master-{mc_version}`: Latest (potentially unstable) development.
* `release-{mc_version}`: Latest stable release for that Minecraft version. This is also tagged with all mod releases.
